# @cosyte/ccda — Project Guide for Claude

## Project

**`@cosyte/ccda`** — a developer-focused C-CDA parser + utility library for Node.js/TypeScript,
published under the Cosyte brand. Open-source (MIT). One of the sibling `@cosyte/*` healthcare-standard
parsers that **mirror each other's API** — `@cosyte/hl7` is the reference; this repo deliberately
copies its shape.

**North star (the archetype):** a developer can parse a real-world, vendor-quirky C-CDA message
and pull useful fields out in one line — without reading the spec. Liberal on parse (quirks become
warnings), conservative on emit (always spec-clean). See `documentation/conventions.md` →
"The standard parser archetype" in the meta-repo for the full contract this repo must satisfy:
Postel's Law, the tiered tolerance model, stable warning codes, zero runtime deps, dual ESM + CJS,
immutability + explicit mutation, and the profile system.

## Status

- **Scaffolded from the shared `@cosyte/*` parser template.** Pre-alpha `0.0.x`, not yet published to
  npm. `src/index.ts` carries archetype **stubs** (`parseCcda`, `WARNING_CODES`, `FATAL_CODES`)
  — the real parser lands in subsequent phases.
- **XML-parser dependency is a pending one-way-door decision.** C-CDA is XML, and the shared standard
  permits an XML-parser runtime dep for `ccda`/`ncpdp` **per an ADR** — but the scaffold stays
  **zero-dep** until the parse layer actually lands. See `docs/adr/0001-xml-parser.md` (status:
  proposed); do **not** add the dependency before that ADR is ratified.

## Tech Stack (the shared `@cosyte/*` standard)

This repo inherits the canonical toolchain by depending on the published `@cosyte/*` config packages,
not by copying files. The source of truth is the meta-repo's `documentation/conventions.md` — this is
a summary.

- **Language:** TypeScript (strict, full rigor set incl. `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`) via
  `@cosyte/tsconfig`. **Target ES2023**, `NodeNext`. TypeScript 5.9.x, exact-pinned.
- **Build:** dual ESM + CJS + `.d.ts` via `tsup` (`@cosyte/tsup-config`); `attw` is a publish gate
  (per-condition types: `.d.ts` for `import`, `.d.cts` for `require`).
- **Node:** **>= 22** (CI matrix 22 + 24).
- **Package manager:** `pnpm@10`.
- **Lint/format:** **ESLint 10** + unified `typescript-eslint` (type-checked) via
  `@cosyte/eslint-config`; Prettier via `@cosyte/prettier-config`. Lint at `--max-warnings=0`.
- **Testing:** **Vitest 4** + v8 coverage (`@cosyte/vitest-config`), per-directory >= 90 gates; the
  property-based conformance invariants come from `@cosyte/test-utils` (round-trip, lenient-mode,
  immutability, warning-code stability) — the format-specific arbitraries stay in this repo.
- **CI/CD:** thin callers of the reusable `cosyte/.github` workflows.
- **Runtime deps:** **Zero for now.** Node stdlib only until the XML-parser ADR
  (`docs/adr/0001-xml-parser.md`) lands; the standard then caps `ccda` at **≤ 3** justified runtime
  deps.
- **License:** MIT.

## Engineering Guardrails

- No `any`. No unjustified `as` casts. Use `unknown` and narrow.
- JSDoc (with `@example`) on every public export — the JSDoc lint rule is an **error** on public
  exports, so this is enforced, not optional.
- Immutable by default. Mutation only via explicit methods.
- No `console.*` in library code. Throw typed errors or return results.
- Short, testable functions over big parsing blobs.
- Postel's Law: parser is liberal (lenient default + warnings), serializer is conservative (always
  emits spec-clean output).
- Fatal errors only for unrecoverable structural corruption (Tier-3 codes). Everything else is a
  warning with a stable code + positional context.
- Coverage: per-directory >= 90% (lines/branches/functions/statements), enforced by
  `pnpm test:coverage`.

## Standing disciplines (every change)

Mirrors the three disciplines in the meta-repo's `documentation/conventions.md` — they bind here too:

1. **Documentation follows code** — a change to the public surface/stack/status isn't done until the
   docs are: this repo's docs content (`README.md`, `docs-content/`), the meta-repo
   `documentation/repos/ccda.md` (bump its "last verified" date), and the `ecosystem-map.md`
   status table.
2. **Version + changelog** — a Changeset (`patch` on the `0.0.x` ladder) + a `CHANGELOG.md`
   `[Unreleased]` entry per meaningful change. Renaming a stable warning code is a **breaking change**.
3. **Crew + knowledgebase loop** — if this parser's public API or warning codes change, flag/update
   the matching `crew` healthcare skill + the KB product doc.

# C-CDA planning notes

_Preserved from the pre-scaffold planning `CLAUDE.md`. The sections above are the shared `@cosyte/*`
standard (authoritative for tooling/stack/disciplines); the notes below are the C-CDA-specific design
intent. Where they overlap, the standard above wins — e.g. runtime deps are **zero today** pending
`docs/adr/0001-xml-parser.md`, and the sibling `@cosyte/hl7` now lives at `../hl7` (the old
`../hl7-parser` path is stale)._

A TypeScript library for the HL7 Consolidated CDA R2.1 standard.

## Ground truth

- **North star:** A developer can parse a real-world, vendor-quirky C-CDA document and pull useful sections out of it in one line — without having read the C-CDA IG.
- **Sibling package:** `@cosyte/hl7` (lives at `../hl7`). This project mirrors its style, tooling, and guardrails. When in doubt, do what `@cosyte/hl7` did.
- **Deliberate divergence from the sibling:** runtime dependencies are allowed here (for XML parsing). Target ≤ 3 runtime deps, each justified. (Pending the XML-parser ADR — `docs/adr/0001-xml-parser.md` — none are added yet.)

## Hard gates

- **≥ 90% line coverage** on `src/parser/`, `src/model/`, `src/templates/`, `src/helpers/` before v1 ships.
- **No `console.*` in library code.** Throw typed errors or return results.
- **TypeScript strict + `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`.** No `any`, no unjustified `as` casts.

## Commit style

Atomic and reviewable. Mirror the commit-message style from `@cosyte/hl7`'s `git log`.
